Simple Shop
This project is the front-end component of a web store built using Vite and Vanilla JavaScript.

Pages:
Categories Page - index.html
On this page, users can view all the products available in the shop. They can filter products by name or by selecting a category, with all filters working together seamlessly. 
By clicking on a product, users are redirected to the product details page.

Product Page - product.html
On the product page, users can see all the details about the selected product. They can return to the categories page and add the product to their cart. 
When users click the "Add to Cart" button, they are redirected to the cart page.

Cart Page - cart.html
On the cart page, users can view all the products they have added to their cart, along with their prices and the total sum for all items. 
Users can adjust the quantity of products, return to the categories page to continue shopping, or click the "Checkout" button to proceed to the checkout page. 
All products added to the cart are saved in local storage, ensuring that users do not lose their selections and quantities.

Checkout Page - checkout.html
On the checkout page, users can see the total amount due and can place their order by entering their name and address. To confirm the order, they can click the "Submit" button. 
Upon successful order completion, an alert is displayed, and users are redirected to the categories page. Additionally, local storage is cleared to remove any previously saved cart items.
